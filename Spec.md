# TODO
- Breadgetter might be a waste of time if...
    - It doesn't 'disrupt' an existing workflow
        * We need think to hard about a seamless Google Drive integration
            - This is important for if we're pivoting too.
        * Ask Rethinking or evaluate yourself what workflows people use when they are helping out the society
    - It doesn't provide good enough value
        * Ask Bex, Conrad and Ann about Breadgetter's simple feature set and whether it's worth pursuing
        * Ask Rethinking's committee about what they might want
            - To be more specific...
                * Do you ever fall behind on the society's current happenings?
                    * Do you think a way of knowing what's been happening inside the committee is useful?
                    - A more neutral question would be...
                        * What's your opinion on something that makes knowing what's going on inside the committee easier?
                * Do you believe the problems Breadgetter addresses are real problems at all?
                    - A more neutral question would be...
                        * What problems do you think Breadgetter addresses?
                * What would you change about Breadgetter?
                * Would you use Breadgetter?
                    - A more neutral question would be...
                        * What are your thoughts on Breadgetter?
        + If things don't pan out, the design and features can be pivoted
    - It's not intuitive to use
        + This is partly addressed by us using Adobe XD instead of being gungho about how we do this. This might be one of the best designed things we ever actually create.

### Why Breadgetter?
Most teams have problems of figuring out what everybody else is up to. Without the knowledge, some people may think nothing is going on and may act lax, when the reality is a lot is happening behind the scenes. Breadgetter aims to eliminate this problem, so that people who fall behind don't fall behind for long. Not only that, but with improved alertness, people are more likely to offer a helping hand, with up-to-date knowledge on what's happening. By keeping everyone on the same page, everybody is doing their best!

Breadgetter improves financial review as well. The standard way, Expense365, has no visualisation, is opaque to all society members aside from a select few (despite the President not having an issue with this), and is not easy to access (there is no web version, it is only mobile).

While Breadgetter cannot replace the Guild's solution for probably legal reasons, its aim is to have better visualisation, access and usability.
