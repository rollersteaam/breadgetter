### Why Breadgetter?
Most teams have problems of figuring out what everybody else is up to. Without the knowledge, some people may think nothing is going on and may act lax, when the reality is a lot is happening behind the scenes. Breadgetter aims to eliminate this problem, so that people who fall behind don't fall behind for long. Not only that, but with improved alertness, people are more likely to offer a helping hand, with up-to-date knowledge on what's happening.

Breadgetter improves financial review as well. The standard way, Expense365, has no visualisation, is opaque to all society members aside from a select few (despite the President not having an issue with this), and is not easy to access (there is no web version, it is only mobile).

While Breadgetter cannot replace the Guild's solution for probably legal reasons, its aim is to have better visualisation, access and usability.
